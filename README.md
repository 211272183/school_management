Question 10
As a group, we as group feel like there can be some room for improvement that can be applied to the domain that was given to us. 
For instance: 
•    The primary key attributes’ naming conventions should be improved, especially for the two entities City and Country which was both named “id” instead it could be called “CountryId” or “CityId”.
•    Address having an ID would make it easier to implement and to understand in terms of code, as we are able to link classes easier that way.
Having 2 extra classes for EmployeeName and StudentName would make the domain easier to implement and there would reduce anomalies and redundancies within tables.
Having a main class with a domain linking to the main class would easier to implement as it would focus the entire groups mindset to make this class work, it would also be easier to implement test cases as we would be able to test everything for that main object. All respective classes like city , address and country would all point to this main entity so it would be easier to pull information about this entity into and from a database query.
The implementation of the program could be more loosely coupled, we could use packages such as a util package and a demography package
Having an ID for name would be easier to implement as it would have its own table and companies would be able to view all names of everyone working in the company and all students.
